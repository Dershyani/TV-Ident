# 3D Gasket TV Ident Animation

### Project Description
This project is a TV Ident animation based on the 3D Gasket program from Angel’s Interactive Computer Graphics (7th Edition, Section 2.10.10). It extends the original gasket4.js to include:

- Rotational animation (180° right, back, 180° left, back)
- Scaling animation (gradually enlarges)
- Interactive movement
- Customizable UI (adjustable parameters for colors, speed, and iterations)

This project was completed as part of CPC354 Interactive Computer Graphics coursework.
